In Douglas Adams' science fiction series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defined a robot as "your plastic pal who's fun to be with," but it was a corporation whose complaints department occupied the major landmasses of three planets and was the only division to constantly show a profit. Technology and automation have provided a huge number of labor-saving devices and have at times relieved humans from having to do monotonous and dangerous jobs such as painting sheet metal or cleaning oil pipelines. However, there are times when one really needs to interact with another human being, and at these times, the automated "customer service" or banking machine is a poor substitute for a human. What differentiates robots from other pieces of technology is their ability to combine automation with action and at times a considerable amount of mobility. They are not only able to do static tasks such as dispense money or direct phone calls, but they can also lift, walk, weld, paint, vacuum, or explore. Unlike most devices that are designed to be used by a human operator, robots are increasingly being built to function within a human environment and are thus becoming more and more humanoid. Perhaps for this reason we view them in a different light than other technologies. They most certainly won't be all plastic, and they may not be our pals, but robots are going to play an increasing role in both scientific and everyday life. It will certainly be interesting to see where we take them and where they are able to take us.
