It is therefore important to understand the development of this disease in order to develop strategies of prevention, treatment, and cure. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) is a complex mixture of chemicals containing high levels of oxidants and is the major etiologic factor in the development of COPD, of which emphysema is a major component. Among the various cell types which compose the lung, the epithelial cells of the alveolar structure appear to be a major target for oxidant injury. It is now well established that type II cells are the stem cells of the alveolar epithelium. After oxidant injury, the rapidity of initiation of type II cell proliferation is crucial for a proper healing. Therefore, characterization of the mechanisms involved in the block of type II cell replication by oxidants and in its reversibility appears to be critical for the understanding and management of many lung diseases associated with oxidative stress. In previous studies, several components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system have been reported involved in the control of proliferation by using a rat type II epithelial cell line, Particularly, accumulation of the IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-2 was associated with block of type II cell proliferation caused by hyperoxia, serum deprivation and glucocorticoid and so on. However the mechanisms regulating human alveolar type II epithelial cell replication upon cigarette smoke exposure remain poorly understood. To provide information on the influence of CSE on the repair capacity of the alveolar epithelium, I am interested in analyzing the effect of CSE on the proliferative response of alveolar type II epithelial cells. To document any protective role of retinoic acid (RA) to reverse the CSE effect, we are to examine the consequence of RA treatment on CSE-induced growth inhibition of type II epithelial cells。Another project is focused on the role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Accumulating evidence suggests that key genes become epigenetically repressed during the course of normal development and aging as well as in the course of diseases such as cancer. it is not known whether this mechanism is involved in hypertension. We are intrigued by our preliminary findings that document an up-regulation in expression of DNMT1 during genetic- and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension. we specifically hypothesize that DNMT inhibition-mediated demethylation and re-expression of eNOS in no-endothelial cells of the vasculature results in increased production of bioactive NO, increased vasodilation, and lowering of blood pressure。曾获兰州医学院1992至1993，1993至1994，1995至1996学年度“”荣誉称号。1997年获“优秀毕业生”荣誉称号。后被评为1997至1998学年度“优秀研究生”。honors and awards：1992至1993  Triple-A Outstanding Student of Lanzhou Medical College。1993至1994  Triple-A Outstanding Student of Lanzhou Medical College。1995至1996  Triple-A Outstanding Student of Lanzhou Medical College。1997  Excellent Graduate of the Year 1997 of Lanzhou Medical College。1997至1998  Excellent Postgraduate of Lanzhou Medical College。JIAO Zongxian, AO Qilin, GE Xiaona, XIONG Mi.
